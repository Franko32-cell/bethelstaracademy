            <h2>Curriculum overview</h2>
            <p>
              Nursery learners begin to engage more intentionally with early letters, sounds, numbers, stories, classroom participation, and personal independence. This stage helps children move from broad early stimulation into stronger readiness for primary school.
            </p>
            <h2>Teaching approach</h2>
            <p>
              We combine structured routines with hands-on exploration, repetition, guided instruction, and creative learning activities. Learning is active, practical, and age-appropriate.
            </p>
