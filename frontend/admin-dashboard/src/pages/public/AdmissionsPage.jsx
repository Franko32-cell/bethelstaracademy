            <h2>Admissions process</h2>
            <p>
              Our admissions process is designed to be clear, supportive, and family-friendly. Parents may begin by contacting the school, visiting the campus, or starting the registration process online. Once an enquiry is made, our admissions team will guide families through the appropriate class placement, required documents, and any assessments that may apply.
            </p>
