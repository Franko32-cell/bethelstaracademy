"""report_view.py
Drop-in replacement for: backend/api/views/report_view.py

Fixes in this pass (mirrors report_pdf_view.py):
  1. `school_class` in the response now reflects the class the student was
     actually in for this term/year's results, not their current
     (possibly since-promoted) class — see school_class_name below.
  2. `position` / `position_formatted` are still computed and returned
     (kept for any other consumer / for backward compatibility), but the
     Reports.jsx frontend no longer renders the overall-position tile.
     Subject-level `subject_position` is untouched.
  3. `out_of` ("pupils on roll") no longer over-counts a class when a
     student has a stray duplicate Result row left over under a different
     school_class_id — a student is only counted toward a class if that
     class is where the MAJORITY of their own subject rows for the term
     actually sit.
