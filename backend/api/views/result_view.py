    Returns the subject total computed live from reopen+ca+exams, rather
    than trusting the persisted `score` column.

    Result.save() is supposed to guarantee score == reopen+ca+exams on
    every write, but a handful of production rows have been found with a
    stale/mismatched `score` (most likely from a raw-SQL data fix, an old
    pre-migration formula, or a duplicate row for the same
    student+subject+term+year under a different school_class — the model's
    unique_together does not include school_class, so that's possible).

    This mirrors _computed_score() in report_view.py / pdf_view.py.
    Ranking (subject positions and the class summary) has to use the same
    source of truth as the per-student report, or a stale row can make a
    student's rank and the total shown on their report disagree.

    This does NOT fix the underlying bad row — run a data-repair pass
    (iterate Result.objects.all() and call .save() on any row where
    stored score != reopen+ca+exams) to fix those at the source.

    (student.school_class_id), not each row's stored Result.school_class_id.

    to a new class is ranked against their actual current classmates —
