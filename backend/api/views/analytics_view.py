"""
Reports & Analytics endpoint for the Admin Settings > Reports tab.

Deliberately does NOT duplicate DashboardView's counts (total_students,
total_teachers, total_classes, total_subjects, total_announcements,
pending/approved_admissions) — the frontend calls both and merges them.
This endpoint only adds analytics DashboardView doesn't already provide:
account-status breakdowns, attendance rate, academic performance, fee
collection, and recent activity.

No "graduated students" stat: there is no graduation concept anywhere in
the current models (Student/User have no such field, and
Report.promotion_status only tracks promoted/repeated/transferred/
withdrawn within the school, not graduation). Omitted rather than invented.

Every section below is built from aggregate queries (Count/Avg/Sum with
conditional Q filters) rather than per-row Python loops, so this stays a
small, fixed number of queries regardless of how many students/results/
attendance records/fees exist — the fees endpoint's earlier N+1 timeout
is exactly the mistake this is written to avoid.
