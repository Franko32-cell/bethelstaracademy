Fixes in this pass (see accompanying notes):
  1. STAGE now shows the class the student was actually in for this
     term/year's results, not their current (possibly since-promoted)
     class. Previously this always read student.school_class, which is
     live/current — so an old report for a promoted student would show
     "STAGE: <new class>" and "NEXT CLASS: <same new class>", making it
     look like the student was promoted into the same class they were
     already in.
  2. Overall class POSITION removed from the visible report (subject-level
     POS. column is untouched). position/position_formatted are still
     computed and passed through internally in case anything else needs
     them later — only the printed row is gone.
  3. "PUPILS ON ROLL" (out_of) no longer over-counts a class when a
     student has stray duplicate Result rows left over under a different
     school_class_id (e.g. an uncleaned mid-term class change). A student
     is now only counted toward a class's roll if that class is where the
     MAJORITY of their subject rows for the term actually sit, rather than
     counting them if they merely have any row under that class id.
  4. PDF-building logic extracted out of StudentReportPDFView.get() into a
     plain generate_student_report_pdf(student_id, term, year) function.
     This is now the single source of truth for building the report PDF —
     both the download endpoint and the WhatsApp-send views
     (api/views/whatsapp_view.py) call it directly with plain term/year
     values. Do NOT reintroduce a pattern where some other view
     instantiates StudentReportPDFView() and calls .get() on it with a
     constructed request object: APIRequestFactory() (and similar) builds
     a plain Django WSGIRequest, not a DRF Request — the conversion that
     gives you request.query_params only happens inside APIView.dispatch(),
     which never runs unless the view goes through .as_view(). Calling
     .get() directly skips that entirely, causing
     AttributeError: 'WSGIRequest' object has no attribute 'query_params'
     the first time this was tried from a WhatsApp-send view in production.
